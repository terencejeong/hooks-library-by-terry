# Terry's Hooks

I made this repo to document my experience with React hooks and to keep hooks that I know I will use in the future. 

Currently my favourite custom hook that I wrote is useMultipleStates.

This hooks takes an array with the name and the initial value. This will then return you a state object with the value, setValue and the initial value. 

Another favourite playaround was with useContext and useReducer. In the context folder, I created my own personal redux, and using these two hooks make it extremley easy.

I am really enjoying hooks and will be adding more as I go along!
